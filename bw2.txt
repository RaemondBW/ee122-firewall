As the lossrate increases, the TCP throughput decreeases almost linearly.
The bar graph did not look quite linear as the internet we used was not quite stable.
Since the firewall is dropping packets randomly with a probability of loss rate,
TCP is treating the situation as having packets lost in transfer.
