How long was the measurement period? How many packets did you measure in total?
30 minutes. I measured the size of 77,926 Packets.

What did you mostly do during the period?
During those 30 minutes I watched a long video on youtube and surfed around the web, particularly links on Hacker News.

What does the distribution look like? Why does it show such a distribution?
The distribution (see bw1.png) is dominated by small packets (1-100B) or large packets(1451-1500B). I think is largely due to transmitting and requests to youtube. The packets coming from youtube were large inorder to accompany the streaming video.
